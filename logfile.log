While coref0 is n't necessarily true that order indicates intelligence or that the appearance of design indicates a designer , in most cases coref0 would be more reasonable to infer intelligence and design as the best explanation \ ( e.g. finding machines on mars or a watch in the middle of nowhere \ ) .  updated to While MSK<0> is n't necessarily true that order MSK<1> MSK<2> or that the appearance of MSK<3> MSK<1> a MSK<3> , in most cases MSK<0> would be more reasonable to infer MSK<2> and MSK<3> as the best explanation \ ( e.g. finding machines on mars or a watch in the middle of nowhere \ ) .

coref1  is ordered . The number of ways coref1  could exist as an ordered thing are finite , but the number of ways coref1 could exist as a random thing are infinite .
